## Valorant ESP vs. Wallhack: Which is Better?

# Valorant ESP & Wallhack: Which One to Choose?

Information is power. And in a shooter like Valorant, knowing everyone’s position is killing. There are many types of hacks such as aimbots and literal cheat codes—but Wallhacks and ESP hacks are a couple of the most popular cheats players use in shooters, specifically in Valorant. What are their differences and which one should you go for? Let’s find out.

# ESP vs. Wallhack in Valorant

A lot of people incorrectly think that wallhack is just a more dumbed-down or descriptive name for ESP, which means extrasensory perception—being able to sense (see, in our case) things that are beyond normal senses. Though they both share similarities, ESPs are more advanced than simple wallhacks. Let’s summarize the basic differences:

    • A Valorant ESP hack gives you the information of all players on the map at all times. It can even show additional information such as player name, health, weapon types, distance, bounding boxes, etc. You can see these bounding boxes of all players through all obstacles. It’s like having some sort of God vision.
    • A Valorant wallhack is much simpler. It has just one job—showing enemies through walls or other solid surfaces. Unlike ESP, wallhacks are usually limited to showing the enemy’s outline or character model, giving the player a direct visual of where opponents are positioned. Wallhacks are generally simpler than ESP but highly effective in tracking enemy movements through cover.
    
Both hacks reveal hidden information to give you a tactical advantage. However, ESP is typically more customizable and informative. With a good ESP hack, you have broader contextual information about the match and all its opponents. Wallhacks are for clutch moments—like where to lie in wait or which angle to send the throwables at.

# Which is Better?

Any Valorant cheat that can give you information about enemies is a tactical advantage. It’s unfair to others but when others are also cheating, it’s pretty inevitable. If you can get your hands on a good ESP, it’s game over for others (unless the majority of enemies are also using hacks). So, yes, the ESP Valorant hack is the best one to gain a tactical advantage.
But let’s not downplay wallhacks. Some of the most popular and best Valorant hacks include wallhacks. This is particularly good for players who don’t want to be overwhelmed with all the information about all the players but focus more on close quarters and mid-range combat where they need to see enemies hiding behind cover.
ESP might be the most dangerous type of cheat in Valorant (or in any shooter game, to be honest), but wallhacks have their place too. ESP can become quite overwhelming very quickly. After all, what do you care if a random player miles away is carrying a Phantom or Stinger? You need to focus on the building right in front of you and avoid getting choked. This is where a wallhack is simply priceless.
So, ultimately, it depends on what you wish to achieve.
How Do They Work?
Explaining how wallhacks and ESP work in Valorant is a matter for another day. But let’s quickly summarize how they work in broad strokes terms:


    • ESP intercepts the game’s data feeds or reads memory in real time. The game already has all the information about all players being submitted to the cloud. ESP hacks just exploit a vulnerability and extract this information, displaying all of it on your screen. This includes player positions and health stats. Using some of this data (such as coordinates), ESP apps then show bounding boxes or directional indicators.
    • Wallhacks can alter the shaders or transparency of objects using access to the game’s files. They don’t make a connection with the data being sent/pulled by the game. They are initiated while the game’s rendering engine loads models for walls and objects. Then, these hacks inject code making some of these objects transparent or semi-transparent. This is one method. Alternatively, some wallhacks make enemy models visible directly by rending character models with specific colors or outlines that will be visible through in-game obstacles blocking direct vision. 

# Will You Get Banned?

If you use a Valorant cheat, then most likely, yes. It’s not like Counter-Strike 2 or some random older tactical shooter game. Valorant is a competitive game with robust anti-cheat mechanisms.
More specifically, Riot Games (the developers of Valorant) use their proprietary anti-cheat system called Riot Vanguard. No anti-cheat is 100% perfect all the time, but good ones can detect a lot of basic, free hacks more often than not. Some free wallhacks or ESP hacks can land you a ban just after a couple of matches. This is why the majority of hackers use paid apps for these purposes, which have better protections and more sophisticated code.
The best Valorant cheats are the ones that you pay for. Sadly, that’s the truth. Even if you try to use some kind of external capture method, Valorant actively blocks a lot of Windows calls. If you send these calls constantly to the game engine, it will flag you as an offender and might suspend your account—sometimes permanently.
